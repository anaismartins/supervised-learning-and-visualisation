1. **Draw an example (of your own invention) of a partition of twodimensional feature space that could result from recursive binary splitting. Your example should contain at least six regions. Draw a decision tree corresponding to this partition. Be sure to label all aspects of your figures, including the regions R1,R2,. .., the cutpoints t1,t2,. .., and so forth. Hint: Your result should look something like Figures 8.1 and 8.2.**
